In this .txt file I will describe what a shader is.
Definition: a shader is just a small program that runs on the GPU instead of the CPU.
In OpenGL, we write it in GLSL language (OpenGL Shader Language), for example:

#version 330 core
// declare variables

void main()
{
    // stuff to put here...
}

This small program is compiled by the GPU driver at runtime, then the GPU executes
it for each vertex or pixel.

Modern OpenGL requires a vertex shader and a fragment shader.
The Vertex Shader:
receives vertex data, transforms it, and outputs a final 4D position to OpenGL

Then, the fragment shader:
executes per pixel fragment by determining the color of each pixel drawn, and does other 
stuff like math, textures, lights, etc...

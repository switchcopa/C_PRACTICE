# ðŸ“š C_PRACTICE â€“ My Journey to Mastering C

Welcome to my **C_PRACTICE** repository!  
This is where I document my progress, challenges, and breakthroughs while learning and mastering the **C programming language**.  
From simple exercises to complex projects, everything here represents my growth as a programmer.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose
- Build a **solid foundation** in C.
- Strengthen understanding of **low-level programming concepts**.
- Practice **data structures, algorithms, and problem-solving**.
- Develop **real-world projects** to apply what I learn.
